# BidCircle - Semester Projct

Welcome to my Vite React app! This app was built using Vite and React.

## Getting Started

To get started, first clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bmsf/semester-project-2.git
```

Next, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd semester-project-2
```

Then, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Finally, start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app should now be running on http://localhost:5173/.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:5173/ to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

```bash
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

```bash
npm start
```

Runs the app in the production mode. Before running this command, make sure to run npm run build to build the app for production.
